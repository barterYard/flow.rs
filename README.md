# Flow Rust SDK

This project uses latest features from Rust 1.56, which will be released on October 21st.

In the meantime, a nightly Rust toolchain is necessary. To install Rust, visit the [rustup] website
for information. Run `rustup toolchain install nightly` to install the nightly toolchain.

## Examples

Examples are in the [examples/] directory. To run an example, e.g. `examples/helloworld.rs`,
